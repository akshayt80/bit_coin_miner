# Introduction

- The project uses elixir and the actor model to generate bitcoins with valid number of leading 0's.

- To maintain uniqueness of the coins from rest of the class we have prefixed the random string
with ufid.

- The bitcoins are mined using the SHA-256 algorithm and the input string with the corresponding
SHA-256 hash is printed.

- The project is implemented as a distributed system where the address of the server is passed as an
argument and then the server starts to distribute the mining operation among the workers. For this
purpose we using tcp (:gen_tcp of Erlang) for communication between server and workers.

- The performace of the system is measured using the ratio of the CPU time to Real time as a metric
and we have discussed the performance for k=4 and k=5.

# Implementation Details

- Work Unit :
For generating the strings, we have used the random string function with a length of 32 bytes. We
used the 32 byte because it will give us a higher probability of getting the bitcoins. In our
distributed model, we have designed the system in such a way that whenever a worker connects with a
server it receives the value of k (leading 0's in a valid coin) and starts sending coins to server
as soon as one of its process finds a valid coin and all the other processes keep on looking for
more coins. At the server we are maintaining a map to make sure that the coins which are generated
are unique. We have make sure that our code remains fault tolerant by not linking one process to
another and just using messaging feature (Actor model) to communicate.

- The test result for K=4 :

real    0m42.799s = 42.799 sec
user    1m17.324s = 77.324 sec
sys     0m0.324s = 0.32 sec

(Total CPU time)/(Number of CPUs) would be same as elapsed real time if the work load is evenly
distributed on each CPU and no wait is involved for I/O or other resources.
		Here, Total CPU time = 1m17.324s = 77.324 sec.
		Real time = 10m42.799s = 42.799 sec
		
		The ratio of CPU time to REAL TIME = 1.80
		

- From our distributed bitcoin miner system, we were able to mine a bitcoin with leading zero's
counting to 9. i.e. for k = 9 we were able to mine a bitcoin.

- We were able to run our code on 11 machines(1 Server and 10 workers) with each having eight cores
and getting the CPU utilization of atleast 720%.
